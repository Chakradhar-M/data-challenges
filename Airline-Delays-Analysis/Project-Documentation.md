### 📌 Background  

Flight delays pose a major challenge to the aviation industry, impacting not only airlines but also airports, service providers, and time-sensitive sectors like logistics and tourism. Delays lead to congestion, inefficient air traffic flow, increased fuel consumption, and heightened carbon emissions, making their mitigation both an operational and environmental priority.

With a wide range of contributing factors, including weather disruptions, air traffic congestion, mechanical issues, and scheduling inefficiencies, it becomes essential to analyze data to detect delay patterns and improve flight punctuality. Data-driven insights can empower stakeholders to enhance operational efficiency and passenger satisfaction while reducing costs and environmental impact.

### 🎯 Objective  

The objective of this project is to create a comprehensive and interactive dashboard that examines flight delay patterns across various dimensions, including:  
✔️ Delay trends by airport, airline, and time of year  
✔️ Identification of the busiest airports and months  
✔️ Analysis of primary causes of delays  
✔️ Comparison of on-time performance among airlines and regions  
✔️ Seasonal and weather-related delay patterns  

This project demonstrates how data visualization and analysis can help aviation stakeholders make informed decisions that support reliability, efficiency, and sustainability in air travel.

### 📊 **Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)**

1️⃣ **Total Arrivals**  
Represents the total number of flight arrivals recorded in the system. This KPI provides a complete view of incoming air traffic volume over a selected time period.

2️⃣ **On-Time Arrivals**  
Represents the number of flights that arrived at their destination on or before the scheduled time. This KPI helps measure operational efficiency and punctuality of airline services.

3️⃣ **Delayed Arrivals**  
Represents the number of flights that were delayed by more than 15 minutes upon arrival. This KPI is crucial for assessing delay patterns and identifying factors impacting flight timeliness.

4️⃣ **Delay Minutes**  
Represents the total number of minutes lost due to flight delays caused by late arrivals. This KPI highlights the cumulative impact of delays and supports root cause analysis.

5️⃣ **Cancelled Flights**  
Represents the total number of flights that were cancelled. This KPI is vital for understanding service disruptions and airline reliability.

6️⃣ **Diverted Flights**  
Represents the number of flights that were diverted from their original destination. This KPI helps track irregular flight operations and support decisions related to emergency or rerouted flight handling.
